Something Epic
==============

An epic HTML5 game, built using CSS transforms and animations and javascript. This game was originally made for the August 2014 Ludum Dare Challenge. It has since been polished and improved.

You control two characters, connected yet independent of one another. Use the keyboard arrow keys or swipe on a mobile device to control your character, and watch them both as they collect coins. Avoid bombs-- if one dies, they both die!
